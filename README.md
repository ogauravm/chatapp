# chatapp

there are two folder here in first folder there is client server model used for chat application in which at port 5001 connection request is sent
in homepage we reruire to enter ip and port number to coonect
server is running when it get a connection request it connect and open chat page
for sending file click on choose file
to receive file we using file prefix basically
a location where images will be stored

in second case peer to peer it is also same as client server but here there is no concept  of server
we simply enter ip and port no of other client and connect call directly
and after connection chat similarily as in client server model
